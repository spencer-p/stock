# stock

I wrote this set of scripts when I was taking Economics in high school and we had a mock stock investing assignment.

I learned a fair amount about web scraping and `awk` scripting, but the analysis this produces is quite low quality. This was before I knew much about statistics or machine learning, so it just lists options in order of some baseless greedy metric. It turns out greedy algorithms are pretty bad at predicting the stock market.

If you want to run it:

```
./investr.sh get
./investr.sh calc
```
